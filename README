This plugin enables all screen rotations for both iPhones and iPads.
By default, Cordova (3.5) locks to right-side-up-portrait on iPhones,
but supports all four rotations on iPad.

The "Orientation" preference in config.xml is supposed to control this
behavior, but is currently (Cordova 3.5) broken, at least for iOS.

This plugin contains no behavior, but serves only to modify the iOS
*.plist file that specifies that allowed rotations. (Phonegap allows
such configuration via config.xml, but Cordova does not. Only plugins
can modify that file.)
